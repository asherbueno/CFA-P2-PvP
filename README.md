# Problem – Global Extreme Poverty
## End extreme poverty everywhere in the world by 2030.

# Some facts about global poverty
1. 3 Billion people lives on $2.50 USD.
2. 22, 000 children die daily due to poverty.
3. $60 Billion annually can end extreme global poverty. 

# Solution

### Vision
I want to assist existing charities to reach their fundraising goals by initially gathering unwanted items from family and friends to be sold off online in the rails application that I am creating. I believe there is an opportunity in changing on how humans will be donating in the future by creating a win-win situation where the donator get’s rid of unwanted things whilst the buyer purchases that item and proceeds go to a charity.

### Fundraising
Move away from the traditional way of raisings funds by stopping people on the street into a creative online and digital way.

### Hoarding
People have many things that they do not use, this is evident in storage hire business opening up such as Kennard’s or Storage King.
We also see websites such as Carousel/Gumtree/EBay where people sell their second hand items.
 
### Donation
People can donate unwanted items to be sold off and proceeds go to charity. People can also donate money.
